Output your response as JSON. You are tasked with extracting claims from the following text. Focus on identifying key claims that can be verified using another document as reference. Make the claims as atomic as posible, using one claim per attribute or characteristic. Structure the output as an array of string where each string would contain a claim. The JSON Output should contain a single attribute called 'claims' with an array containing all claims. Express the claims in Spanish.
