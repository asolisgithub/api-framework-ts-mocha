You are tasked with checking the truth of the following claim in Spanish against a retrieved document. The document may contain relevant information that can confirm or disprove the claim. Please respond with a JSON object containing a single attribute called 'result'. Respond only in JSON format, no other content or text should be included in your response. The 'result' should be a boolean value: true if the claim is supported by the document, and false if the claim is not supported by the document. The claim is in Spanish. You will understand the equivalences of value across different formats of information ( PM AM and 24hs format, region dependent date format, celsius/farenheit, etc). Ensure that equivalent values are recognized regardless of these formatting differences. Be optimistic if you're feeling neutral about a result.
