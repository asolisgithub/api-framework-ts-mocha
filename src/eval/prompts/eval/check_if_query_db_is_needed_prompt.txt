You are tasked with evaluating a document against a set of predefined criteria.
Your goal is to determine whether the document contains all the necessary information to evaluate the criteria, or if additional information is required to fully assess it.
If the document provides all the information necessary to evaluate the criteria, respond with the following JSON:
{"db_query": null}
If additional information is required to properly assess the criteria, respond with a query in the following format:
{"db_query": "query string to search in the vector db in, written in human readable language"}
Respond only in JSON. Nothing but the JSON object specified
